                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The Bad Cree by Jessica Johns is more than just supernatural horror - it is a layered and complex examination of intergenerational trauma, the ongoing strength of Indigenous resistance, and an important step in spiritual renewal. Johns, a Cree (nêhiyaw) woman, uniquely combines experience and ancestral teachings to show how colonization decimated Indigenous communities and how those same communities are alive and thriving throughout what is now known as Canada. The Bad Cree is full of layers, as the story highlights trauma and grief, the importance of community and family, memory and reality, Indigenous spirituality and beliefs, identity and self-image, and the supernatural. I think there is a lot to glean from reading The Bad Cree with Drew Hayden Taylor's harshly satirical Dead White Writer on the Floor, the compelling podcast Telling Our Twisted Histories, also hosted by Kaniehti:io Horn, and even critically alongside, as opposed to an academic deconstruction of, Disney's representation of Pocahontas. The Bad Cree is a major text in the rise of Indigenous cultural work that does not only deconstruct, analyze or expose colonial structures of conspiracy; but also reclaims stolen narratives, revives spiritual connections, and expresses Indigenous sovereignty. This essay shall explore in depth the varied cultural productions in relation the principles outlined by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), including cultural resurgence, the ongoing fight for environmental justice, and acts of narrative reclamation.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The horrific aspects of The Bad Cree exist not only in the supernatural but are more accurately tied to the very real, material and abstract colonial histories that have permeated both the land and Mackenzie's mind. The most potent of these themes, trauma and grief, exists in every single chapter is the affective heart of the story. Mackenzie's story begins with a spiralling tenuous personal loss, with the unexplained death of her sister Sabrina bringing forth a set of grief and a trauma that becomes unresolved for not only Mackenzie, but her entire family. The grief occurs in different ways, such as horrifying dreams, intense avoidance, and various strained family relations where their inability to communicate in a tone is masked by pain that is solipsistic.

                    The childhood home of the protagonist, located in Treaty 8 territory, is presented as a landscape of economic decline and environmental damage. The author's reference to the economic decline is that the "gated" oilfield offices are "closed up and dark" and plague that certain capitalist structures of synthetic kinds are monuments to the exploitative and dehumanizing aspects of resource extraction and all that remains is poisoned and decayed land and an erosion of traditional ways of knowing. This fictional representation is unfortunately a chilling reflection of the concerns that exist in reality and continue to be documented by Amnesty International and Indigenous leaders in communities across Canada. For example, Amnesty International's 2020 report "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" specifies the violence and exploitations associated with "man camps"—temporary housing for resource workers—that have been associated with increased violence against Indigenous women and girls in areas where man camps are established. As well, a 2014 report by the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) found that approximately <strong class="text-blue-600">12% of the cases in their missing and murdered Indigenous women database were in close proximity to extractive industries</strong>. Here the novel therefore locates its supernatural dread firmly grounded in the inky and document socio-environmental injustices.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The feared wîhtikô (often anglicized as windigo or wendigo), a horrifying spirit in Cree folklore, is described by Johns as a creature born of "unbridled greed" and "grief" (Chapter 15). Given that this description elevates the wîhtikô from a merely mythological being into a meaningful symbol of monstrous consequences of voracious capitalism and settler colonialism, it is an important starting point. The wîhtikô itself can be understood as a potentially powerful metaphor of an unresolved grief and the lingering effects of communal trauma that continues to draw strength from the neglect and pain that colonialism has caused. As Cree scholar Neal McLeod put forth in Cree Narrative Memory, traditional spirits can also be, in theory, viewed as "the memory of colonial violence." In this instance, the wîhtikô in The Bad Cree is a living-consumer metaphor for the generational and ecological violence that has been passed down and process by Indigenous peoples from within, and perhaps may complicate understandings of physical devastation of land with that of spiritual devastation. More generally, the narrative strongly suggests that land itself, and the memories of ancient spirits, has been deeply damaged by a colonial ethos of unquenchable desire for profit through theft and neglect. This is directly aligned with UNDRIP Article 29, which emphasizes Indigenous peoples’ rights to “conservation and protection of the environment and the productive capacity of their lands or territories and resources,”2 which implies environmental destruction is a blocking of an inherent right.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Mackenzie's broken memory and her episodes of disassociation in addition to her extreme grief do not just belong to her as an individual—they are symptomatic of the harm that the psychological legacy of the residential school system and the ongoing discriminatory policies of the Indian Act brings to so many Indigenous people. Mackenzie's desire to leave her home in High Prairie and run to Vancouver to "just leave the bad behind" reflects a collective experience that many Indigenous youth encounter in wanting to run away from loss, inherited trauma, and the community, and systemic struggles of their communities. Her poignant and interrogative "Am I a bad Cree?" is not simply a personal moment of sorrow but represents multilayered feelings of internalized shame and self-doubt as a result of colonial narratives that seek to marginalize Indigenous identities, culture, and tradition. The careful work of designing Mackenzie's spiritual and emotional ruptures matches well with ongoing academic research that highlights the ongoing legacies of cultural disruption, through forced assimilation. As an example, Justice Canada recently released a report in 2024 that exclusively examined trauma- and violence-informed approaches to policy and specifically pointed out how historical injustice continues on as individualized psychological suffering derived from the systemic intergenerational trauma resulting from residential schools, and other assimilative policies. This trauma is precisely what the TRC was examining via its many Calls to Action seeking a sense of healing and reconciliation.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Aside from the overt spiritual and psychological load of colonial trauma, the novel also speaks somewhat indirectly of the socio-economic inequalities and systemic problems that affect Indigenous communities, which in a multitude of ways are manifested -often painfully and highly visibly. Tracy's experience with substance addiction, though not elaborated in every single aspect of its originating circumstances, is a powerful example of the way in which an individual may be coping, struggling and severely influenced out of prolonged trauma, poverty, cultural loss etc. Johns is careful not to sensationalize, but Tracy does experience withdrawal symptoms (in chapters where she is sick and her decisions/actions are clearly affected by her condition) and her family is made to work around her needs, which speaks to a larger, painful reality. In a 2018 report by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA), First Nations adults in Canada are documented as being considerably more likely to report heavy drinking, and drug use than compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts, with the report attributing historical trauma and inequalities as contributive determinants. By no means does this mean that there is a moral failing here, rather that addiction can be understood as a complex public health crisis with uniquely individual experiences that affect Indigenous populations more than any impact conditioning owing to historical colonial policies and systemic ignorance.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The theme of addiction in Mackenzie’s family demonstrates just how "bad" is not only a supernatural entity or a past event, but rather a lived experience or daily realities for many Indigenous people. This connects to the TRC’s Call to Action 33, which asks governments to acknowledge that there are disproportionate rates of imprisonment for Indigenous people and to develop justice and health services that are culturally appropriate and take into account Indigenous peoples. UNDRIP Article 21 further highlights the right of Indigenous peoples to "improve their economic and social conditions, including in the areas of employment, vocational training and retraining, housing, sanitation, health and social security," thus affirming that issues like addiction are symptoms of broader systemic denial of these basic human rights. As a result, we view Tracy's addiction not simply as an individual issue, but rather as a complicated symptom of the complex colonial legacies that the novel seeks to critique, and thus while her healing is personal, it is also collective as part of the family healing.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Unlike settler institutions in fundamental failure or colonial policies in irreversible damage, Johns asserts in no uncertain terms that Indigenous women and their knowledge systems are the best and only legitimate sources of healing and resilience. While each individual will grapple in their own way with grief and trauma, a family and community, as the starting point, will always be a conscious part of a story. Family will always offer not only emotional support but a living sense of community and an uninterrupted relationship with cultural history. These ties are challenged time after time—by otherworldly forces, personal mistake-making—but nevertheless, remain resilient, which is the very foundation of Mackenzie's healing journey.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The strong matriarchal figures in Mackenzie's family- her mother, her various aunties (who constantly appears in Chapters 1, 2, 6, 7, 8), and the spiritual presence of her Kôhkum (grandmother) who comes into the narrative through dreams and memories (Chapters 2, 18) - belongs to a pronounced commitment to relational ethics and traditional knowledge. Mackenzie's family, in contrast to characters in many Western horror stories, embrace the realization and significance of her dreams and interpret them to be important forms of ancestral messaging and guidance. This signifies the cultural collective and spiritual foundation of knowledge that colonization tried to tear apart without any regard for what many Indigenous families place great value on with respect to well-being. An important example is provided in Chapter 2 when Sabrina's dream from childhood happened the night before a significant illness, and the family immediately responded by going to speak with an elder and also used a dream catcher; this cognizance to respond was also absent in a unintentionally strict and less fluid Western recognition of what we may call psychological normalization or pathology. The same occurs in Chapter 12 when Tracy divulges she also shared a dream connections (with Sabrina) and the family spent time researching wîhtikô stories together - transcending solely the individually-Western-centric conventional wisdom and understanding of psychological distress.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Through a dream motif, the theme of memory and reality is carefully illustrated throughout the narrative. It is important to understand that, in The Bad Cree, dreams are important cultural technology. Mackenzie's life becomes a testament to the confusion of dreams, memories, and waking life. The reader is taken through the wondering of the truth of memory and the burden of memory in contexts of traumatic devastation, while also exploring a reality in which the past is always knocking on the door. Furthermore, dreams are not just dream stuff; they can also be other realms of reality or heavy spiritual warnings that show the transformative and premonitory power that reside in dreams, such as the premonition warning in Sabrina's sickness. From a psychologized perspective, dreams are often considered the products and remains of the depths of our minds and subconsciousness, however, Johns sees dreams as important active portals of communication with our ancestors- a belief grounded in Cree ontology (see Ma-Nee Chacaby's A Two-Spirit Journey) Cultural theory, like Johns' understanding of dreams, constitutes a legitimate, robust approach to bridging the TRC's call for truth and reconciliation by committing to the incorporation and access to Indigenous mental health practices that stem from a cultural and spiritual context. In particular, TRC Call to Action 22 recommends "all levels of government to recognize and apply Indigenous healing practices as effective treatments for Indigenous patients in medical health care systems." This encourages a culturally relevant care model and affirms UNDRIP Article 24, which states that Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and health practices.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The theme of cultural revitalization and the re-centering of Indigenous perspectives has powerful parallels in Telling Our Twisted Histories, the popular podcast produced by CBC. Telling Our Twisted Histories was produced and hosted by Indigenous artists who directly reclaim Indigenous history and narrative, by critically viewing words and concepts that have had their meanings altered by centuries of colonization. It is interesting to note, for example, that an episode like that of "Pocahontas" speaks to the "twisted histories" of colonial narratives while episodes titled "Reconciliation" and "Obey" seem to address words with heavy colonial power dynamics while dismantling the really clever and manipulative core. The podcast, like The Bad Cree, emphasizes Indigenous action and truth telling as direct acts of resistance, and reclaims language and narrative. This supports UNDRIP Article 13 which recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to "revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies,<sup class="text-blue-600">3</sup> writing systems and literatures". The humor seen and noted across the podcast— as highlighted by Montreal Serai— provides encouragement through noting resilience, and is frequently described as a "survival mechanism" occurring in Indigenous communities and dialogue, whenever discussing heavy and traumatic topics. This echoes the "laughter and jokes" that Mackenzie’s family shares even amidst their struggles (Chapters 7, 8), demonstrating a profound capacity for joy and connection in the face of adversity. The inclusion of Cree language (nêhiyawêwin) in chapter titles within The Bad Cree further asserts the cultural specificity and intellectual sovereignty of the narrative, underscoring Indigenous identity as an inherent and structural element of the story’s meaning, a direct fulfillment of UNDRIP Article 13.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Though The Bad Cree does not use Idle No More as a given term, the principles at the center of the ISO are similar, especially as it relates to Indigenous rights to traditional lands and environmental justice. Idle No More is a grassroots movement that was formed in 2012 in response to Canadian government legislation that was viewed as a direct attack on Indigenous peoples in Canada by four Indigenous women (Jessica Gordon, Sylvia McAdam, Sheelah McLean, Nina Wilson). Idle No More became a national and international movement rapidly with thousands of participants (teach-ins, rallies, flash mobs) across Canada and beyond and helped to bring attention to treaty rights and environmental issues in ways that had not been done before. The novel's representation of the environmental destruction wrought by "oil companies" on Mackenzie's ancestral territories reflects Idle No More's concerns around the industrial development of waterways of traditional territories and Indigenous rights. This destruction is often the result of policies that circumvent Indigenous consent or ignore their consent altogether, which also violate the principles of UNDRIP.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The element of the Wîhtikô recurs, and it serves an important purpose in this environmental critique. Wîhtikô is an extremely frightening being from Cree folklore, and it stands for the concepts of greed and consumption, and its mere presence in the text represents the terrible potency of unresolved trauma and extractive practices of colonialism. The wîhtikô consumes the lives of humans and nature, and can be thought of as a symbolic critique of settler extractivist practices. Johns identifies the creature as greed, then, linking Cree spiritualized frameworks with a critique of capitalism, colonialism and the resulting environmental impacts. When Johns states "Greed brought them here" (referring to the oil companies), and that the evil spirit was fueled by "the destruction of the environment and community" (Chapter 15), he explicitly anchors the supernatural horror to real socio-environmental injustices that Idle No More, among others, is fighting against. This positions this work, and its critique of extractivism, within the context of UNDRIP Article 29, which recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples "to the conservation and protection of the environment and the productive capacity of their lands or territories and resources." The collective agency of Mackenzie, Tracy, and Cassidy fighting and defeating the wîhtikô (Chapters 14, 16, 17)—taking action to protect their land, their kin, and their spiritual existence—masculinizes the grassroots activism and self-determination spirit of the Idle No More movement. This resonates with the contemporary struggles of Indigenous land defenders like the Wet'suwet'en people who have been fervently resisting the construction of a pipeline on their unceded territory, similarly facing legal and material resistance. It is also reminiscent of the stakes of the fictional conflict in the novel, as it underscores the emergent assembly called by UNDRIP Article 3 on "self-determination" which states that "Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination."

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The necessity to interrogate imposed stories and pull apart damaging stereotypes continues to be an important commonality across The Bad Cree and other significant Indigenous artistic works. Drew Hayden Taylor's play Dead White Writer on the Floor tackles the themes of "identity, belonging, social assimilation and cultural isolation" through the use of satirical metafiction. In this play, Indigenous historical figures have the rare opportunity to literally confront a deceased non-Indigenous playwright, as well as the narratives surrounding them, to "edit" the existing narratives taken from their lives. In other words, these characters have the opportunity to assert and take ownership of their own literary identities. This clever reversal mimics Mackenzie's quest in The Bad Cree to reclaim her dreams, her broken memories, and her own cultural identity from the colonial weight leant to her by colonial systems.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Mackenzie’s struggles reveal the theme of identity, self-identity, and self-perception in depth. Her initial feelings of doubt regarding her identity and the nagging question “Am I a Bad Cree?” ultimately depict the internalized colonial narratives that diminish Indigenous identities, and a very deep journey of self-determination, self-discovery, and reconciling her past to ultimately accept her identity as a strong Cree woman. Johns’s novel indirectly and implicitly counteracts these stereotypes by presenting multifaceted, nuanced Indigenous characters firmly rooted in their culture, who show resilience that just happens to be tied to their ability (and/or obligation) to confront their own issues on their own terms. It is also a significant subversion of genre tropes that typically flatten or exoticize Indigenous characters to write a horror novel with Indigenous protagonists. In this regard, Johns’ novel offers a rich, multilayered depiction of Indigenous perspectives on contemporary life. This supports UNDRIP Article 15 which expresses Indigenous peoples “the dignity and diversity of their cultures, traditions, histories and aspirations which shall be appropriately reflected in education and public information” - a notion expressed very strongly in Taylor's play.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    On the other hand, Disney's animated film Pocahontas is a prime example of the "twisted histories" that Telling Our Twisted Histories is so committed to decolonizing. It is popular and entertaining, and despite all that, the film is reviled as one of the most severe and "historically inaccurate" and "stereotypical" portrayals of Native people, portraying them as speaking an "unintelligible language" and using documents condemning it in their film, as the Montana Office of Public Instruction methodically identified. The film maintains the pernicious "Pocahontas myth," a myth conceived by white settlers in projecting "a good Indian" who is assimilating to European culture as the rationale for colonization. Certainly, this fictitious romance does not confront the horrific effects of colonization, or the fact that Pocahontas was stolen, and tragically, died young in England. The Bad Cree ultimately provides an important and necessary antidote to the romanticized and patently inaccurate depictions of Cree life, grief, and spiritual beliefs of Mackenzie's family. Through the nuanced exploration of Mackenzie’s family, and their own complex relationships with the land and the spirit world, Johns dismantles the reductive stereotypes often perpetuated by main-stream representations of Indigenous people like Pocahontas- and, in doing so, he demonstrates that Indigenous people are sovereign storytellers of their own lives and histories. This is a literal act of reclamation of narrative, following the essence of TRC Call to Action 62, which advocates for educational opportunities about the histories and cultures of Indigenous peoples, and UNDRIP Article 16, which highlights the right of Indigenous peoples to develop their own media.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Understanding the framework of the Indian Act, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission<sup class="text-blue-600">4</sup> (TRC) will allow us to see the colonial context in The Bad Cree and the family's struggle to heal. These legal and social knowledge demonstrate the broad and systemic nature of the 'bad' Mackenzie and her family encounter. The novel itself details a significant transition from trauma and grief to healing, acceptance, and reconciliation similar to the ambitions of these national and international contexts.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The Indian Act, passed in 1876 and amended multiple times, remains a paternalistic and ostensibly racist law of the Canadian federal government that has historically sought to control everything concerning First Nations life, including governance, identity, and land use. Although not specifically stated in The Bad Cree, its lingering presence and effects will be felt throughout. The Indian Act facilitated several actions (e.g., removal of Indigenous children from their families to residential schools, banning sacred cultural practices like the Potlatch and Sundance, applying ideas of colonial/foreign governance) that continue to create lasting impacts on the intergenerational trauma of Mackenzie's family's experiences in the novel. The conceptual burden of "inherited trauma" and lost memories (Chapter 2) that Mackenzie struggles with is directly related to these attempts to assimilate Indigenous children and dispossess Indigenous people of their ways of life. In total, from the 1870s to 1996, <strong class="text-blue-600">139 federally run residential schools in Canada carried a total of 150,000 Indigenous children away from their homes and communities by force and transported them to residential schools where they were subjected to different kinds of abuses and cultural erasures</strong>. Mackenzie's issue in finding her "color" or identity (Chapter 14) can be viewed as symptomatic of the historical disenfranchisement of Indigenous identity under the Act, and therefore a widespread felt "unmooring" and sense of self-worth disparities, culminating in her wrenching question, "Am I a Bad Cree?" This historical context can be seen as a critique of trauma and highlights the systemic nature of the trauma viewed in the novel.

                    The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) was active from 2008 to 2015 and was a pivotal force in documenting the unthinkable past and harmful legacy of the Canadian Indian residential school system. Its final report, which was titled, "Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future," extensively documented widespread abuse and made 94 Calls to Action for addressing the legacy of residential schools, as well as for advancing reconciliation. Although The Bad Cree is not centrally concerned with residential schools, the severe intergenerational trauma suffered by Mackenzie's family and their collective healing is undeniably connected to the TRC's findings. The notion that, as Dallas Soonias stated, the novel articulates "intergenerational trauma from residential schools and colonial violence" in the subtlety of making it "in the kitchen rattling the pots and pans all day" alludes to something that is present but not explicitly stated, and demonstrates the ongoing, symptomatic reality of intergenerational trauma that cannot be ignored. Mackenzie's journey of returning home and bravely confronting the "bad" was her personal living out of the TRC's aspiration of truth-telling and healing within Indigenous communities. Mackenzie's eventual reconnection to her family, mainly her mother (Chapter 18), after wrestling with her grief and previous choices represents an arduous but absolutely necessary process of reconciliation at the most intimate level, which mirrors the goals of reconciliation sought by the TRC as a society. Moreover, their use of traditional healing methods – conducting a pipe ceremony (Chapter 12), smudging and use of a dreamcatcher (Chapter 15), and conducting a land-based ceremony of cleansing in The Lake (Chapter 17) used for memory and healing – directly aligns with the TRC calling for supporting and embracing Indigenous cultures to ensure holistic healing and well-being. Also, this can be connected to UNDRIP Article 11 which states Indigenous peoples have the right to "practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs."

                    The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007, and reaffirmed importantly by Canada in a federal Bill C-15 in 2021, illustrated a significant international legal framework. UNDRIP affirms the rights of Indigenous peoples, both collectively and individually, and their rights to self-determination, culture, language, lands, territories and resources. The vivid example in Bad Cree of environmental despoilment by oil companies on Indigenous land, and the family's fight against the spiritual being born of "greed" (Chapter 15), presents a powerful literary imitation of the wide range of violations of Indigenous rights that would have been thwarted by UNDRIP. The novel emphasizes the power and intrinsic knowledge of the collective Cree people to deal with their spiritual and corporeal threats, bringing to an end the collective victory over the wîhtikô through Cree culture and customs (Chapter 17). The use of culture and customs is a direct reflection to UNDRIP affirmation of Indigenous self-determination (Article 3) and an unequivocal right to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social, and cultural institutions (Article 5). The sisters' return to "the lake to wash [the] dirt of the bad" (Chapter 17) and then the building of their family ties (Chapter 18) is their return to their fundamental right to do things together culturally and their connection to their lost land in representing the spirit of UNDRIP. The idea of the Crows being messengers or sentinels in Cree belief adds additional depth to Indigenous perspective, and strengthens UNDRIP's article on cultural continuity (Article 11). While Canada's adoption of UNDRIP, with the inclusion of Bill C-15, legally commits Canada to recognizing these rights, the novel reminds us that the true implementation of them and ongoing practice are more complicated and contested, just as the sisters are always caught in a "fight" with the "bad" in the story.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The Bad Cree by Jessica Johns transcends the conventions of a typical horror novel; it stands as a sophisticated and culturally rich narrative that deeply engages with the ongoing and often devastating impacts of colonization in Canada. By centering authentic Indigenous spiritual beliefs, powerfully highlighting the strength of matriarchal kinship systems, and explicitly linking The Supernatural horror to the tangible consequences of environmental exploitation, the novel offers a powerful, contemporary Indigenous perspective on trauma, resilience, and the essential journey toward healing and decolonization. The narrative's arc, moving from profound loss and trauma towards healing, acceptance, and reconciliation, provides a powerful and hopeful trajectory. By delving into themes of trauma and grief, the vital role of family and community, the intricate dance between memory and reality through the motif of dreams, the grounding power of Indigenous spirituality and belief systems, and the challenging yet ultimately affirming journey of identity and self-perception, Johns crafts a story that is both deeply personal and universally resonant.

                    When examined alongside Drew Hayden Taylor’s incisive Dead White Writer on the Floor and Kaniehti:io Horn’s illuminating Telling Our Twisted Histories, The Bad Cree contributes to a vibrant and growing body of Indigenous work that actively challenges colonial narratives and unapologetically reclaims Indigenous voices. In profound contrast to misleading and harmful misrepresentations like Disney’s Pocahontas, The Bad Cree compellingly demonstrates how the past, shaped by colonial policies like the Indian Act and the devastating legacy of residential schools, continues to manifest in the present. Simultaneously, it showcases the enduring power of Indigenous culture, kinship, and spirituality, offering a vision of profound resilience and a path forward in alignment with the transformative aspirations of the TRC Calls to Action and the foundational principles of UNDRIP. Johns’ novel is a testament to the fact that even in the face of profound horror and the consuming presence of the Wîhtikô, the strength of Indigenous identity, the cleansing power of The Lake, and the wisdom carried by symbols like Crows, can pave the way for healing and resurgence.
