                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>The Bad Cree</strong> by Jessica Johns is a complex text that employs supernatural horror to focus on intergenerational trauma, Indigenous resistance, and spiritual renewal.
                    <br><br>
                    The horrors lie in colonial histories—economic decline, environmental destruction from resource extraction, and “man camps”—and how those losses manifest as grief and trauma for characters like Mackenzie.
                    <br><br>
                    The <em>wîhtikô</em> embodies the monstrous consequences of uncontrolled greed, settler colonialism, and unresolved trauma. It links visible destruction (the land) with invisible suffering (spiritual decay), showing that trauma cannot be neatly compartmentalized.
                    <br><br>
                    Mackenzie’s interior struggles—disassociation, broken memory, self-doubt—are manifestations of psychological trauma inherited from residential schools and the Indian Act, which influence her coping strategies and feelings of internalized shame.
                    <br><br>
                    Issues like addiction (Tracy) are framed not as moral failings, but as public health issues rooted in systemic inequality.
                    <br><br>
                    The text elevates Indigenous women and their knowledge as key sources of resilience—through matriarchs, ancestral dreams, and ceremonies.
                    <br><br>
                    Dreams are not merely subconscious but are Cree ways of communicating with other realms, emphasizing Cree ontology.
                    <br><br>
                    The novel aligns with works like <em>Telling Our Twisted Histories</em> and <em>Dead White Writer on the Floor</em>, challenging colonial narratives and stereotypes (e.g., Disney’s <em>Pocahontas</em>).
                    <br><br>
                    It echoes the <strong>Idle No More</strong> movement’s values: reclaiming lives from capitalist forces, restoring environmental justice, and affirming Indigenous sovereignty.
                    <br><br>
                    The <strong>Indian Act</strong>, <strong>TRC</strong>, and <strong>UNDRIP</strong> are key frameworks presented in the novel that represent both the trauma and the paths toward healing.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Broader Significance and Lasting Impact</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>The Bad Cree</strong> is an important work in Indigenous literature, not only deconstructing colonial trauma but also reclaiming stolen narratives and reconnecting spiritual ties.
                    <br><br>
                    It illustrates how traditional Indigenous knowledge and beliefs provide powerful pathways to address intergenerational trauma and ecological crises.
                    <br><br>
                    The novel subverts Western ideas of healing by centering place-based, culturally relevant care and honoring Indigenous practices.
                    <br><br>
                    It decolonizes the horror genre by presenting culturally grounded, complex characters who resist colonial tropes and assert identity.
                    <br><br>
                    This work reinforces the ongoing relevance of resistance movements like <strong>Idle No More</strong> and emphasizes environmental justice by tying spiritual identity to land.
                    <br><br>
                    It reminds readers of the urgency behind TRC’s Calls to Action and UNDRIP as blueprints for real reconciliation.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Reading <strong>The Bad Cree</strong> has reshaped my understanding of historical trauma, environmental injustice, and Indigenous spirituality. The metaphor of the <em>wîhtikô</em> as colonial greed made me realize how systemic oppression becomes normalized.
                    <br><br>
                    I was especially moved by the matriarchal strength and traditional healing practices embedded in the story. The wisdom and resilience of Indigenous peoples continues to inspire me.
                    <br><br>
                    In the future, I want to explore how Indigenous authors use genre fiction to engage with political issues, as well as the real-world applications of TRC and UNDRIP in shaping policy and healing.
                    <br><br>
                    This novel has encouraged me to continue amplifying Indigenous voices and contribute to a more informed, just understanding of Indigenous cultures, histories, and futures.
