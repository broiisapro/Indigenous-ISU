    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This website is a personal portfolio that documents my learning and growth in Indigenous education. Through reading, reflecting, and engaging with Indigenous authors and perspectives, I’ve come to understand the importance of truth, reconciliation, and storytelling.</p>

    <h2>Books & Reflections</h2>

    <div class="reflection">
      <h3><em>The Break</em> by Katherena Vermette</h3>
      <p>This powerful novel opened my eyes to the intergenerational trauma and strength of Indigenous women. The use of multiple perspectives emphasized community and resilience. I began to understand the pain and beauty of reclaiming identity after colonization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="reflection">
      <h3><em>Indian Horse</em> by Richard Wagamese</h3>
      <p>Through Saul's story, I learned about the horrors of residential schools and the healing power of sports and storytelling. This book deepened my empathy and taught me how historical trauma continues to impact Indigenous communities today.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="reflection">
      <h3><em>Seven Fallen Feathers</em> by Tanya Talaga</h3>
      <p>This nonfiction account introduced me to systemic injustices faced by Indigenous youth. The investigation into student deaths revealed ongoing neglect and discrimination. It motivated me to advocate for Indigenous rights and education reform.</p>
    </div>

  </section>

  <section id="growth">
    <h2>My Growth</h2>
    <p>At the beginning of this journey, I had limited knowledge of Indigenous history and culture. I’ve since come to recognize the importance of listening, learning, and unlearning. My ability to engage respectfully with Indigenous perspectives has grown, and I now strive to be an ally by supporting Indigenous voices and initiatives in education and beyond.</p>
